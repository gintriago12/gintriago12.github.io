## About me
![Img](https://ibb.co/n0FjnfR)
Hi! I am a Ph.D. student in Electrical Engineering at the University of California, Santa Cruz.
My passion is to make the electric power grid smart, and secure.
I dedicate my research in connecting electric power systems and machine learning algorithms that evolve over time.


## Qualifications

**Programming languages:** Matlab, and Python proficient.

**Machine Learning:** I took a graduate class, and I am currently working on evolving machine learning models for power systems.

**Leadership:* I served for two years as the president of the Entrepreneurs Club during my undergrad.

**Telemetry:** Hardware lead for several telemetry projects during three years

**Optimization:** I took the three graduate classes, 1) numerical optimization, 2) convex optimization, and 3) optimization for power systems
