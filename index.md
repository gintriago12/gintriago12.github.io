## About me
![](https://postimg.cc/1VBmqLSP)

Hi! I am a Ph.D. student in Electrical Engineering at the University of California, Santa Cruz.
My passion is to make the electric power grid smart, and secure.
I dedicate my research in connecting electric power systems and machine learning algorithms that evolve over time.


## Qualifications

**Programming languages:** Matlab, Python, and bash scripting.

**Machine Learning:** Coursework and experience applying machine learning to conduct experiments on data. Recently, I presented the article "Online Dictionary Learning Based Fault and Cyber Attack Detection for Power Systems" in a Best Paper Session at IEEE PES GM 2021 conference.

Estimation: Two years of experience in power systems state estimation, acquainted with Kalman filters, particle filters, weighted least squares, and other methods.

Control: Coursework and experience designing basic controllers for linear systems. Graduate classes taken, 1) feedback control systems, 2) applied feedback control, and 3) digital control

Telemetry: Hardware lead for several telemetry projects during three years at Telconet, and one year and a half as the project lead for an environmental monitoring telemetry project at ESPOL.

Optimization: Coursework. Graduate classes taken, 1) numerical optimization, 2) convex optimization, and 3) optimization for power systems.

Leadership: I served for two years as the president of the Entrepreneurs Club during my undergrad.
