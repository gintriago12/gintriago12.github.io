## About me
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gintriago12/gintriago12.github.io/main/images/telconet2.jpg)

I am a Ph.D. student passionate about making the electric power grid smart, and secure. My research interests lie in the intersection of microgrids, fault diagnosis, and machine learning for data streams.


## Qualifications

**Technical Courses:** AC Microgrids (AAU University), Active Fault Tolerant Control (AAU University), Time-Domain Simulations (DIgSilent PowerFactory).

**Programming languages:** Matlab, Python, and Bash scripting.

**Machine Learning:** Coursework and experience applying machine learning to conduct experiments on data. Recently, I presented the article "Online Dictionary Learning Based Fault and Cyber Attack Detection for Power Systems" in a Best Paper Session at IEEE PES GM 2021 conference.

**Estimation:** Two years of experience in power systems state estimation, acquainted with Kalman filters, particle filters, weighted least squares, and other methods.

**Control:** Coursework and experience designing basic controllers for linear systems. Graduate classes taken, 1) feedback control systems, 2) applied feedback control, and 3) digital control

**Telemetry:** Hardware lead for several telemetry projects during three years at Telconet, and one year and a half as the project lead for an environmental monitoring telemetry project at ESPOL.

**Optimization:** Coursework. Graduate classes taken, 1) numerical optimization, 2) convex optimization, and 3) optimization for power systems.

**Leadership:** I served for two years as the president of the Entrepreneurs Club during my undergrad.
